# ALU_SYSYTEM_VERILOG_VERIFICATION
This project describes the complete testing and verification process for a parameterized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) utilizing an advanced, class-based SystemVerilog verification environment. The core purpose is to confirm the operational accuracy and performance of the ALU implementation through a well-organized and scalable testing methodology.
